# Furllamm Donation Slogan Template 🎁

This is a simple and beautiful HTML template for developers to share with their users and invite optional donations.

## 💡 Why?

Not every project finds instant success. But even small support can create a big impact — especially when it helps children and learning.

## 🧰 How to use:

1. Replace `INSERT_PAYMENT_LINK_HERE` in `index.html` with your own donation/payment link (PayPal, Ko-fi, Wallet, etc.).
2. Host it on GitHub Pages or include it in your app.
3. Share with your community, if you feel like it.

## ✨ Inspired by

🧠 This template was inspired by the style of donation platforms like "Buy Me a Coffee".
